# CompSciBot
A multifunction bot for the CompSci Bois Discord

There are some environment variables that need to be set for the bot to function. Some have default values, but parameters like the bot token need to be provided using environment variables or a .env file. These values are shown below, alongside their defaults if they have them:

```
TOKEN - the bot token
PREFIX (c!) - the bot prefix
THRESHOLD (3) - the number of posts needed to add to the starboard
AUTOASSIGN_ROLES (True) - whether or not to autoassign roles on join
MEMBER_ROLE (member) - the member role name
BOT_ROLE (bot) - the bot role name
STARBOARD_NAME (starboard) - the starboard channel name
```
